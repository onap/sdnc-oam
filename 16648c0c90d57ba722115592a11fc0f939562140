      "message": "Those can be added too.. but maintaining those in CCSDK would be hard\n\nAs everytime ccsdk/parent poms would need updates as soon there is new release artifact available for sdnc northbound and a1-adapter\n\nRather all ccsdk package versions are already being maintained properly.\nMoreover of parent poms have older version and not being updated, then those versions can be always oveeridden here :)",
