      "message": "Could you please explain why a1-adapter-northbound has been removed from here? The A1-ADAPTER-API has stopped working after this change.\nI guess you are trying to enable SDNR\u0027s feature inclusion based on setting some env variables. However, a1-adapter is not part of SDNR and it should be always included in SDNC image regardless of these env variables.",

      "message": "okay. there are two things.\n[1] featureRepositories: This is added where it correctly belongs, so in fact it is a ccsdk repository it will be added in ccsdk/distribution in the odlsli image. So everything should be fine from this side. I checked the latest sdnc-image and found your repo: mvn:org.onap.ccsdk.oran/a1-adapter-northbound/1.1.1/xml/features\n\n\n[2] featuresBoot: sdnr-northbound-all is only added by startODL.sh if env var SDNR_NORTHBOUND\u003dtrue. now we have three options.\n[2.1] we can add in oom your a1-adapter-northbound feature to the env: SDNR_NORTHBOUND_BOOTFEATURES\u003d\"sdnr-northbound-all,a1-adapter-northbound\" so that this will be overwritten in startODL.sh and added by setting the SDNR_NORTHBOUND\u003dtrue\n[2.2] we can establish a new env var A1_ADAPTER_NORTHBOUND\u003dtrue (by default false) and add the feature by startODL.sh like we do it for sdnr-northbound-all\n[2.3] we can add it permanently to startup, so bring it back here into the docker files\n\nsorry that we missed that.",
